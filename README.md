# Wh40K

A project started by me with support from artists, friends, teachers and streamers.</br>
This game is inspired by the Paradox Interactive Strategy games like EU4, HoI4 and Stellaris.</br>
</br>
The [Trello](https://trello.com/b/7ys0oSK0/segmentum-obscurus) also has the GGD.</br>
This is purely a pashion project that only has loose gameplay elements that still need to put together into something cohesive.</br>
Development began early to mid 2020 and is the best representation of my current programming skills.
